# Neverthink

Here is my solution for neverthink assignment, I used Context to pass and change
the state of the app in the children components.

For creating the responsive layout I listened the onLayout event from the view and based of the
orientation I provide a specific style to the components

For this task I made two different versions of the app with different layouts, tha main one is located in the master branch. The other one is found in the branch called "version2"

## Installation

Download the app from the repository
Start and android emultor or connect a device
Enjoy!

## Usage

```javascript
RUN METRO SERVER
npm run start

RUN APPLICATION IN ANDROID DEVICE
npm run android
```

# Dependencies

```
react-native-youtube
```
